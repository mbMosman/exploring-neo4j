This site presents a project that I completed for the ICS611 course in the MSCS program at Metropolitan State University in Fall 2016.  The project includes a series of short, informal papers that explore the neo4j database along with a basic project that illustrates its use.  

### Papers

- [Overview](part1-overview.html)
- [Installation & Setup](part2-install.html)
- [Application Design & Implementation](part3-app-design-impl.html)
- [Application Use Cases](part4-app-use-cases.html)
- [Transactional Support](part5-transactions.html)

### Presentation

(Hopefully a video will follow when the work is completed...)
